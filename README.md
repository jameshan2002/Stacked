Capital One Summit Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
Customers want to know how they spend their money, sometimes you can blow away your budget without even knowing it.

**Capital One Stacked** provides a monthly summary of each customerâ€™s spending habits, categorized by needs/wants and overall trends in your transactions. This empowers users to be more cognizant of their spending habits, visually helps users budget more healthily, promotes conversations on better spending habits, and encourages users to share their milestones with others.

## What Stacked does
After you sign up at capital one, you can log into your account and see your monthly summary of how you have spent.
