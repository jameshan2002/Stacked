## Inspiration
Capital One Customers want to know how they spend their money, sometimes you can blow away your budget without even knowing it.

**Capital One Stacked** provides a monthly summary of each customerâ€™s spending habits, categorized by needs/wants and overall trends in your transactions. This empowers users to be more cognizant of their spending habits, visually helps users budget more healthily, promotes conversations on better spending habits, and encourages users to share their milestones with others.

## What Stacked does
After you sign up at Capital One, you can log into your account to see your monthly summary of your transactions.

It provides users with flexibility regarding their wants and needs while still giving nonpunitive recommendations on how to improve budgeting habits.

Finally, you can promote healthier conversations around spending habits by exciting and enabling users to share their Stacked statistics with their family and friends.
