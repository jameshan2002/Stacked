## Inspiration
Capital One Customers want to know how they spend their money, sometimes you can blow away your budget without even knowing it.

**Capital One Stacked** provides a monthly summary of each customer’s spending habits, categorized by needs/wants and overall trends in your transactions. This empowers users to be more cognizant of their spending habits, visually helps users budget more healthily, promotes conversations on better spending habits, and encourages users to share their milestones with others.

## What Stacked does
After you sign up at Capital One, you can log into your account to see your monthly summary of your transactions.

It provides users with flexibility regarding their wants and needs while still giving nonpunitive recommendations on how to improve budgeting habits.

Finally, you can promote healthier conversations around spending habits by exciting and enabling users to share their Stacked statistics with their family and friends.

## How we build Stacked
- Front End: React Native (For more flexibility to use on both iOS and Android.
- Back End: Back4All -> Firebase -> JSON

## Difficulties
- Frontend
  - Difficulties with React Native setup on some computers, including proper installations/packages
  - Leveraged team members’ skill sets to divide and conquer the tasks at hand
- Backend
  - Had some trouble connecting backend platforms like Firebase and Back4App with our React Native app
  - Created sample data that emulates what our backend would ideally look like



## Future Features
- Recommendations: Personalized recommendations for users to improve financial habits, tracking percentage of income spent rather than actual dollars.
- Share Functionality: Our share could be implemented across a broader range of social media platforms.
- Improved Design: Animations could be implemented in individual wrap slides to add pizzazz.
